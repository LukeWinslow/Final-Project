                <p> Qin china was a unique period in chinese history. The chinese have a very different history and pattern from the rest of the world.
                    Historically China has fallen into civil war time and time again. The Qin were one of these dynasties ruling for ~400 years. 
                    They are most famous for building the great wall of china in an attempt to keep the mongols out. However, that wallo under the rulership of Qin Shi Huang
                    litteral millions of chinese were killed to build the wall. The worst fate you could have would be falling asleep and being forced to be burried alive inside of the wall.
                    I challenge you to find a worse fate than that. While Emperor Qin Shi Huang was pretty evil that doesn't apply to all of China at this time. 
                    While they were under the harsh code of Confusionism there were many inventions of this time. Most notiable is the first bureaucracy in the world.
                    If you would like to look more in-depth on the Qin Chinese society this is a link to a wikipedia page.
