            <p>Ancient Romeleft a profound impact on Western civilization. Known for its vast empire, legal systems, engineering marvels, and cultural influence, Rome introduced concepts like republican governance and extensive laws. 
                Its military prowess led to territorial expansion, while remarkable architectural and engineering feats, such as the Colosseum and aqueducts, showcased their ingenuity. 
                Roman literature and mythology, influenced by the Greeks, produced renowned authors, and their administrative systems and Latin language influenced subsequent societies.
