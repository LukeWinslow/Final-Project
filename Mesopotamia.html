                <p>Mesopotamia is largly regarded as the first well known ainchent civilization. 
                    This civilization, like the early Chinese and Egyptians, was built around a river. 
                    We often see ainchent societies being built around rivers due to the availibility of
                    clean water as well as the predictability of the patters of the rivers. If you would like 
                    to look more in-depth on the ancient Mesopotamian society this is a link to a wikipedia page.

                    This is an example of the writing that ancient Mesopotamians wrote in. It consists of lines with points or arrows on the end.
                    It is a very special writing style that is difficult for modern speakers to understand.
